# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

With the exception of Scala, solutions are stored in the following format:

```
src/main/language/<year>/<day-number>
```

Scala solutions are in:

```
src/main/scala/io/github/aaronreidsmith/<year>
```

Input files, if they exist, are in:

```
src/main/resources/<year>/<day>.txt
```
